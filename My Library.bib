Drawing on both the ANES January 2016 pilot survey and exit poll data, we argue that Trump's rise to the GOP nomination was facilitated by a broad-based appeal that centered on voters who have levels of education and income that are well above national and primary state averages.},

Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We find that Trump's supporters voted for him mainly because they share his prejudices, not because they're financially stressed. It's true, as exit polls showed, that voters without four-year college degrees were likelier than average to support Trump. But millions of these voters\textemdash{}who are often stereotyped as ``the white working class''\textemdash{}opposed Trump because they oppose his prejudices. These prejudices, meanwhile, have a definite structure, which we argue should be called authoritarian: negatively, they target minorities and women; and positively, they favor domineering and intolerant leaders who are uninhibited about their biases. Multivariate logistic regression shows that, once we take these biases into account, demographic factors (age, education, etc.) lose their explanatory power. The electorate, in short, is deeply divided. Nearly 75\% of Trump supporters count themselves among his enthusiastic supporters, and even ``mild'' Trump voters are much closer in their attitudes to Trump's enthusiasts than they are to non-Trump voters. Polarization is profound, and may be growing.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of water-supply development programs in the Global South, their effect on gendered access to water remains both unclear and contradictory. This paper addresses this lacuna by examining the expansion of a rural water-supply network aimed at reducing household water scarcity in the arid zone of Rajasthan, India. Specifically, the Indira Gandhi Canal was conceived and constructed during the green revolution to `green the Thar Desert'. But now, through a complex network of reservoirs, treatment facilities, distribution centers, and supply pipelines, it connects much of rural and urban western Rajasthan to a drinking water-supply network. The paper examines the interaction of water-supply technologies, social power relations and dynamic socioecological change operating within these development processes. To do so it draws on household surveys, interviews with water users and government engineers, and participant observation with women and children water collectors. The paper finds that this ongoing water development project rendered the water provision landscape technical on the surface, but that uneven flows of water between villages and people reveal a more complex water provision landscape. The expansion of the network based on a technical reimagining of water supply has resulted in intervillage scarcity, intragender differential access, usurious private water markets, the abandonment and then the proposed rehabilitation of traditional water bodies, and urban water logging. In the conclusion I argue for a rethinking of water-supply development programs through a political ecology approach that focuses on the emergent capacities of water-supply technologies to redirect existing socioecological associations in unanticipated ways. Looking at the relationship between nature\textendash{}society and technology may illuminate the possible ruptures in these associations and the ways that they may be rearticulated to produce less differentiating modes of accessing water.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I analyze the connections made between women and water in a Rajasthani drinking water supply project as a signiWcant part of drinking water's commodiWcation. For development policy makers, water progressing from something free to something valued by price is inevitable when moving economies toward modernity and development. My Wndings indicate that water is not commodiWed simply by charging money for it, but through a series of discourses and acts that link it to other ``modern'' objects and give it value. One of these objects is ``women''. I argue that through women's participation activities that link gender and modernity to new responsibilities and increased mobility for village women involving the clean water supply, a ``traditional'' Rajasthani woman becomes ``modern''. Water, in parallel, becomes ``new'', ``improved'' and worth paying for. Women and water resources are further connected through project staV's eVorts to promote latrines by targeting women as their primary users. The research shows that villagers applied their own meanings to latrines, some of which precluded women using them. This paper Wlls a gap in feminist political ecology, which often overlooks how gender is created through natural resource interventions, by concerning itself with how new meanings of ``water'' and ``women'' are mutually constructed through struggles over water use and its commodiWcation. It contributes to critical development geography literatures by demonstrating that women's participation approaches to natural resource development act as both constraints and opportunities for village constituents. It examines an under-explored area of gender and water research by tracing village-level struggles over meanings of latrines.},

  abstract = {The widespread trend to transfer irrigation management responsibility from the state to ``communities'' or local user groups has by and large ignored the implications of intra-community power differences for the effectiveness and equity of water management. Gender is a recurrent source of such differences. Despite the rhetoric on women's participation, a review of evidence from South Asia shows that female participation is minimal in water users' organizations. One reason for this is that the formal and informal membership criteria exclude women. Moreover, the balance between costs and benefits of participation is often negative for women because complying with the rules and practices of the organization involves considerable time costs and social risks, whereas other ways to obtain irrigation services may be more effective for female water users. Although effective, these other and often informal ways of obtaining irrigation services are also typically less secure. More formal participation of women can strengthen women's bargaining position as resource users within households and communities. Greater involvement of women can also strengthen the effectiveness of the organization by improving women's compliance with rules and maintenance contributions. Further detailed and comparative research is required to identify the major factors that affect women's participation and control over resources, if devolution policies are to address the tension between objectives of transferring control over resources to community institutions, and ensuring the participation of all members of the community, especially women.},

This article introduces a framework for disaggregating conditions of access to water and uses it to examine three pressing questions in Bangladesh. First, extraction of groundwate r for irrigation has made many drinking-water hand pumps run dry. Second, increasing use of groundwater for drinking has been associated with the poisoning of at least 20 million people through naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater. Third, the article examines some of the ways access to water has been changed by the rise of shrimp aquaculture for export. This article highlights new directions for the analysis of interactions among water, class, and gender. The existing literature has tended to focus on the implications of gender analysis for government policy, especially development projects and water resources management, and for women's organization. In this article we begin to sketch some questions that arise from a concern to understand the broader context of social change.},

The fact that power, expertise and status in irrigation tend to have a strong masculine connotation is by now quite well established, and underlies calls for more women in water decision making, engineering education and professions. Yet, the questions of how and why water control, status and expertise are linked to masculinity, and of whether and how such links work to legitimise the exercise of power, are seldom asked. To date, associations between masculinity and professional water performance have largely been taken for granted and remained unexamined. The resulting perceived normalcy makes mechanisms of (gendered) power and politics in water appear self-evident, unchangeable, and indeed gender-neutral. The article reviews examples of the masculinity of irrigation in different domains to argue that exposing and challenging such hitherto hidden dimensions of (gendered) power is important for the identification of new avenues of gender progressive change, and for shedding a new and interesting light on the workings of power in water.},

This paper addresses three questions: 1) How could a focus on social relations illuminate access to water? 2) Is there statistical evidence of a water-poverty connection? 3) How could time allocation studies improve our understanding of access to water? First, evidence suggests that in much of the rural global South, gender relations in particular mediate the social relations of water in numerous, interconnecting ways. Analysis of gender relations could then improve our understanding of the multiple connections among poverty, the position of women and access to water. Second, statistical evidence from the Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment Report 2000 and from the World Development Report 2000 indicates that there is a correlation between lack of access to water and material poverty. When people lack access to water and material resources, they are unable to realize their own hopes for life. Third, in order to improve our understanding of how people in the global South obtain water, future studies will need to determine precisely who collects and manages water for various uses, how much time water collection consumes, and the quality of water available to each user.},

In contrast to policy deliberations and prevailing perception that the primary role of women is confined to that of domestic users of groundwater, the survey results of the study confirm that women also make substantial use of groundwater for productive purposes. The results confirm that a large number of women continue to travel many times a day to collect water for various uses. Women travelled an average of three times in a day for 50\textendash{}77 min per trip to collect drinking water, depending on the season. Improved access to a reliable and proximate water supply reduces the time spent by women in collecting water and the proportion of hard labour performed by women. Respondents indicated improved water access translated as diversified livelihood activities that increase their income earning potential and help strengthen their bargaining position. The majority of women respondents in the Meghraj watershed in Gujarat (80\%) and the Dharta watershed in Rajasthan (76\%) believed that they have equal chances of being selected in ground water management committees. In contrast, only 15\textendash{}20\% of interviewed women considered they were empowered to make difference in the domains of income, crop production and resource use.},
